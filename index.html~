                            <p>Nukomeet is a cooperative of nomad hackers. We are organized like a pirate ship and split our time between client projects and internal ventures. Together we do ruby on rails, ipad, ios, android apps, and even static websites and pub crawls. It started in early 2012 after badass polish hacker Zaiste crashed at my temporary headquarters in Paris for a month. Together we decided to start a small innovation democracy that would both feed us and provide us for a playground for our craving of edge tech and disruptive apps.

                               Some reports from the trenches can be found on Nukomeet or Coworfing blog. I also use both blogs for promoting an another way of working and collaborating.
